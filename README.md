## Getting Started
There are three separate npm projects, a REST API, a GraphQL, and a React App.

REST API:
```
cd /rest-api
npm i
npm start:dev
```

React App:
```
cd /react-app
npm i
npm start
```

## Heroku Production
Two Heroku apps are used, one for the React application, and one for the REST API.
